              Some believe NFTs are trash. Others believe trash is art. We
              believe it can be all.
              <br />
              <br />
              Value can be subjective, and we get to collectively decide in what
              we place value to. One element TrashDAO is experimenting with is
              decentralizing curated image practices. Curation has historically
              been a centralized process involving a few key individuals within
              the confines of esteemed institutions. With TrashDAO, each
              individual adding an NFT to the ‘trashpile’ is curating and
              therefore adding value to the visual dialogue that is TrashDAO.

              We are currently in the earliest innings in the development of
              DAOs where lots of challenges exist with regard to decentralized
              coordination. TrashDAO is an experiment by which we aim to explore
              the limits and possibilities of truly decentralized coordination
              via tokenholder voting that gets executed on-chain without
              trusting a simple multisig of owners.

              $TRASH does not have any prior determined allocations and is 100%
              minted by the community. It is truly a decentralized “fair launch”
              approach to tokenomics. At time of launch, the only way of
              acquiring $TRASH is via depositing trash to the TrashDAO. Swap any
              NFT from the qualified contracts and receive 69 $TRASH tokens in
              return. Using the SZNS interface, TrashDAO members can make other
              standardized proposals as a DAO member.

              The tokenomics are vague and equal for a reason. And the future of
              the project is unwritten. We implore the community to shape the
              DAO as they desire and submit proposals with SZNS. For example, a
              proposal to award users with even more $TRASH based on certain
              NFTs, deposit a non-trash NFT (or is it still trash) such as a
              Bored Ape, and receives 42069 $TRASH in return. Uncap the total
              supply? The possibilities are endless.

              Artistic inspiration for the TrashDAO effort comes from visions
              created in the TRASH ART community, legends like Jay Delay and
              projects such as Rats.Art. There is existing literature around the
              Crypto Trash Art movement, but to summarize,{" "}
